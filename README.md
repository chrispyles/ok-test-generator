<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrispyles/okpy-test-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chrispyles/okpy-test-generator) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/chrispyles/ok-test-generator/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/chrispyles/ok-test-generator) -->

This is a small Angular application that generates Python test cases in OK-format. This test format is used in various autograders, including [Otter-Grader](https://github.com/ucbds-infra/otter-grader), [OkPy](https://github.com/okpy/ok), and [Gofer-Grader](https://github.com/data-8/gofer-grader).

The generator can be found at [https://oktests.chrispyles.io](https://oktests.chrispyles.io).
