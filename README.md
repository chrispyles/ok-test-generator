# Okpy Test Generator

This is the source code for a Heroku-deployed webapp that generates Python test cases in ok format. This test format is used in various autograders, including [okpy](https://github.com/okpy/ok) and [gofer-grader](https://github.com/data-8/gofer-grader).

The generator is at [https://oktests.herokuapp.com](https://oktests.herokuapp.com).
